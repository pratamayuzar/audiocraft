The track is driven by prominent traditional drums and kendang, layered with contemporary synthesizer textures that add a modern edge. The arrangement alternates between rhythmically intense sections and hook-driven instrumental choruses, creating a vibrant, danceable soundscape. This composition highlights a balance between organic traditional sounds and modern production techniques.",
