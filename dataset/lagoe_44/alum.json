The song opens with a strong rhythmic foundation provided by kendang (traditional drums and percussion), gradually evolving into a vibrant dance beat enriched with contemporary synthesizer layers. Lively, the beat, creating a festive atmosphere that invites listeners to dance. The dynamic arrangement transitions seamlessly blending traditional elements with modern production for an immersive musical experience.",
