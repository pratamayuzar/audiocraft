    "description": "An upbeat koplo instrumental track that showcases the high-energy, rhythmic drive typical of the genre. The composition is anchored by fast-paced, pulsating kendang beats, intertwined with modern electronic percussion elements. Layered synthesizer textures and a steady bass line provide a dynamic, dance-inducing groove. The arrangement features vibrant, syncopated rhythms with alternating segments of driving energy and catchy instrumental hooks, encapsulating the spirited and lively essence of koplo music.",
